# Tic-Tac-Toe in Kotlin

## 📌 Overview
A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game written in Kotlin. Two players take turns playing as `X` and `O`, and the game continues until a player wins or ends in a draw.

## 🎯 Features
- Interactive 3x3 grid with user input validation.
- Detects **win conditions**, **draws**, and **invalid moves**.
- Error handling for non-numeric and out-of-range inputs.
- Clean and efficient Kotlin implementation.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter coordinates (`row col`) where you want to place `X` or `O` (1-based indexing).
3. The game checks for a **win, draw, or continues**.
4. The game ends when someone wins or there's a draw.
